	Broken MANIFEST causing missing file!
	

0.039	2017-11-01

	Broken metadata (?)
	
	PAUSE claims failure on indexing; try again to drop away a few things that I'd
	rather not have show up as bona fide modules (even if they are)...

0.038	2017-11-01

	Bug fixes and feature changes
	
	NOTE: not all is backwards compatible!
	
	A revamp of the hidden _pp flag, now includes _info stuff to enable the listing
	of conditions (e.g. versions of modules, config etc) for the non-packed and
	packed copy respectively.
	
	--defines didn't make it into the meta file
	
	renamed some samples to better use .t as the preferred (perl code) test
	extension
	
	Addition of a postprocess mechanism similar to preprocess
	
	The default/internal execmap is now not automatically used for safety reasons,
	must be requested.
	

0.037	2017-10-16

	Change in Config::Std 0.901 => 0.903 unexplicably broke a 'use Config::Std qw(read_config)' line in App::TestOnTap which consequently broke a test...

0.036	2017-09-02

	Don't trap preprocessing STDERR

0.035	2017-08-08

	New capability: 'preprocess' for env/argv
	Minor bug fixes
	Upgrade to latest Grep::Query

0.034	2017-05-22

	Drop the actual creation of a binary by directly using 'pp'
	
	Instead just print a suitable cmd line so user can modify if necessary.

0.033	2017-05-15

	A recent Test::More fix changed a behavior (empty output line removed). 
	
	Well, problems to repro. Rewrite offending test slightly...

0.032	2017-04-23

	A recent Test::More fix changed a behavior (empty output line removed). 
	
	Now generates errors the other way...try for latest Test::Simple dist.    

0.031	2017-04-18

	A recent Test::More fix changed a behavior (empty output line removed). 
	
	Test and dependency updated.    

0.030	2017-04-11

	When using 'suiteroots' as URL:s to zip files, use LWP::UserAgent and disable host check for https

0.029	2017-04-01

	Non-backwards compatible rewrite of the execmap
	
	No longer deals with just 'file extensions', but instead actual
	Grep::Query expressions. This makes it possible to be very fine-grained
	in how individual tests are run. In particular, using --no-harness and
	--execmap from the commandline makes it easy to run a single test with a
	debugger.
	    

0.028	2017-03-23

	* Now accepts a zip archive instead of a suite directory, and will unpack
	before running.
