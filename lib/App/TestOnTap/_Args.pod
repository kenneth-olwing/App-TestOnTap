=head1 NAME

App::TestOnTap::_Args - hidden flags

Commandline options and arguments understood for TestOnTap processing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 testontap
    [ --_help ]
    [ --_pp ]
    [ --_pp-variant <value> ]
    [ --_pp-output <path> ]
    [ --_pp-force ]

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

All options can be abbreviated, as long as they are unambiguous. Option matching is case
sensitive. Forcibly end option parsing using '--'.

=head2

This documents some 'hidden' flags, generally because they're somewhat particular and/or
not ready for prime time...

The regular verbose flag may be used to raise verbosity one or more levels.

=item B<--_help>

Displays usage and help with options/arguments. If given, nothing else will be done.

=item B<--_pp>

Signals that it should generate a binary using PAR::Packer (must be installed first).
If given, this option causes all other options to be ignored (apart from the accompanying '--_pp-*' flags below).

Note that this can not be used when you already run a binary.

When a packed binary is run, any C<PERL5LIB> envvar is just dropped which is understandable, but as a very special
case, you find it needed when running the tests, set the C<TESTONTAP_PERL5LIB> to the desired value and the
C<PERL5LIB> variable will be reinstated with that value during the tests running.  

=item B<--_pp-variant E<lt>valueE<gt>>

This is an optional value that will be tacked on to the automatically calculated name by
I<--_pp-output>. If given, it will be prefixed with a dash and placed at the end of the name.

=item B<--_pp-output E<lt>pathE<gt>>

If this option is not given, a default name of the binary will be computed and placed in the current directory.

The default name is the script name, the version number, the os, the arch, the variant
(set by I<--_pp-variant>, if any) and for Windows, the '.exe' suffix.

  Examples:
    testontap-0.123-windows-x86.exe
    testontap-0.123-linux-x86_64
    
    # with I<--_pp-variant foo>:
    testontap-0.123-windows-x86-foo.exe
    testontap-0.123-linux-x86_64-foo

If the given path doesn't exist, assume it is the actual full path and filename. Note that a given variant
will not be present in that case as the automatical name never is computed.

If the path is an existing directory, use the default name above and write it to the directory.

If the ultimate name already exists, an error will be thrown. See the force flag to ignore that check in order
to overwrite.

=item B<--_pp-force>

Setting this option will cause the existing file to be deleted before a new is created.
