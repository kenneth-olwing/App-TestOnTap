=head1 NAME

App::TestOnTap::_Args - hidden flags

Commandline options and arguments understood for TestOnTap processing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 testontap
    [ --_help ]
    [ --_pp ]

=head1 OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

All options can be abbreviated, as long as they are unambiguous. Option matching is case
sensitive. Forcibly end option parsing using '--'.

=head2

This documents some 'hidden' flags, generally because they're somewhat particular and/or
not ready for prime time...

=over

=item B<--_help>

Displays usage and help with options/arguments. If given, nothing else will be done.

=item B<--_pp>

Signals that it should print out a basic commandline to generate a binary using the 'pp' command from
PAR::Packer (must be installed first). If given, this option causes all other options to be ignored.

Print to a batch file/shellscript or similar, and run it separately, editing any flags as needed. As
an example, a Perl was built on a host against a private openssl installation. It turned out that
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and options '-l ssl -l crypto' was needed to properly bring the necessary flags in.  

Note that this can not be used when you already run a binary.

When a packed binary is run, any C<PERL5LIB> envvar is just dropped which is understandable, but if you find it
is needed when running the tests, set the C<TESTONTAP_PERL5LIB> to the desired value and the C<PERL5LIB> variable
will be set with that value during the tests running.
