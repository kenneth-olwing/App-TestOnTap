	Non-backwards compatible rewrite of the execmap
	
	No longer deals with just 'file extensions', but instead actual
	Grep::Query expressions. This makes it possible to be very fine-grained
	in how individual tests are run. In particular, using --no-harness and
	--execmap from the commandline makes it easy to run a single test with a
	debugger.
