0.054	2019-01-06

	Test failure fixes:
	Travis randomly failed on test 60-preprocess; possibly linked to using POSIX/getcwd instead of Cwd/getcwd
	Archive::Zip has a security feature where a zip can't extract to a path with symlinks in it, exposed through a cpan tester who has that setup

0.053	2019-01-03

	Added option --dryrun and improved output during --no-harness/--dryrun
	Only warn (don't die!) about 'meaningless' match/dependson queries

0.052	2018-12-19

	Need a minimum version on List::MoreUtils

0.051	2018-12-19

	Improve parallelization configurability
	
	    Typos
	    Allow to cap the --jobs max (on Windows by default capped to 60)
	    Add configuration handling of 'parallel groups' in order to
	    specify max concurrency for certain groups

0.050	2017-12-28

	
	Add support for merging in the harness
	Pack changes
	-Make the _pp_script executable
	-Embed more info (user, host, env) into the packed bin
	-Allow script to avoid any info at all

0.049	2017-12-13

	Change the layout of the resulttree to more easily understood naming

0.048	2017-12-05

	Beautify error if a suite zip is broken
	Rewrite (again!) of the hidden pp args and how they work

0.047	2017-11-30

	Don't require 'cmd' value for directly executable binaries
	Remove the explicit deps on PAR, PAR::Packer and dynamically check for them
	Fix sample suit for new execmap style

0.046	2017-11-14

	Removed module remained in personal Perl...

0.045	2017-11-13

	Non-backward compat changes
	
	Removed the --execmap mechanism, instead replacing with the ability to specify a
	full config instead.
	Made some mods to the --_pp/info flags
	The style of the execmap is rewritten to use a better list/section combo for
	each match
	
	

0.044	2017-11-06

	Clean up warn message

0.043	2017-11-06

	Failure in automated smoke tests
	
	But without verbosity, hard to figure out - simplified

0.042	2017-11-05

	Changes to how config works
	
	Revamp config handling to be required to exist, but allowed to be empty and defaults will kick in
	Add execmap support for AutoIt
	Make sure preproc/postproc output is put in saved results
	Attempt to hide _Args pod
	

0.041	2017-11-02

	Missing dependencies (PAR; PAR::Packer)
	

0.040	2017-11-02

	Broken MANIFEST causing missing file!
	

0.040	2017-11-02

	Broken MANIFEST causing missing file!
	

0.039	2017-11-01

	Broken metadata (?)
	
	PAUSE claims failure on indexing; try again to drop away a few things that I'd
	rather not have show up as bona fide modules (even if they are)...

0.038	2017-11-01

	Bug fixes and feature changes
	
	NOTE: not all is backwards compatible!
	
	A revamp of the hidden _pp flag, now includes _info stuff to enable the listing
	of conditions (e.g. versions of modules, config etc) for the non-packed and
	packed copy respectively.
	
	--defines didn't make it into the meta file
	
	renamed some samples to better use .t as the preferred (perl code) test
	extension
	
	Addition of a postprocess mechanism similar to preprocess
	
	The default/internal execmap is now not automatically used for safety reasons,
	must be requested.
	

0.037	2017-10-16

	Change in Config::Std 0.901 => 0.903 unexplicably broke a 'use Config::Std qw(read_config)' line in App::TestOnTap which consequently broke a test...

0.036	2017-09-02

	Don't trap preprocessing STDERR

0.035	2017-08-08

	New capability: 'preprocess' for env/argv
	Minor bug fixes
	Upgrade to latest Grep::Query

0.034	2017-05-22

	Drop the actual creation of a binary by directly using 'pp'
	
	Instead just print a suitable cmd line so user can modify if necessary.

0.033	2017-05-15

	A recent Test::More fix changed a behavior (empty output line removed). 
	
	Well, problems to repro. Rewrite offending test slightly...

0.032	2017-04-23

	A recent Test::More fix changed a behavior (empty output line removed). 
	
	Now generates errors the other way...try for latest Test::Simple dist.    

0.031	2017-04-18

	A recent Test::More fix changed a behavior (empty output line removed). 
	
	Test and dependency updated.    

0.030	2017-04-11

	When using 'suiteroots' as URL:s to zip files, use LWP::UserAgent and disable host check for https

0.029	2017-04-01

	Non-backwards compatible rewrite of the execmap
	
	No longer deals with just 'file extensions', but instead actual
	Grep::Query expressions. This makes it possible to be very fine-grained
	in how individual tests are run. In particular, using --no-harness and
	--execmap from the commandline makes it easy to run a single test with a
	debugger.
	    

0.028	2017-03-23

	Implementation of --no-harness feature

0.027	2017-03-22

	Added the testinfo.json file to the result.

0.023	2017-02-13

0.021	2017-02-12

0.013	2017-01-31

	natural to express a query.
	* Now accepts a zip archive instead of a suite directory, and will unpack
	before running.
